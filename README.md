# Smart Relay for ESP8266 12-F

A versatile and efficient solution for controlling devices using the ```ESP8266 12-F``` microcontroller. This project is designed to be **compatible with almost all Arduino platforms**, making it a flexible tool for developers and hobbyists alike.

## Key Features

- **MQTT Messaging System**: Seamlessly communicate with your devices using the lightweight and efficient MQTT protocol.
- **Persistent Configuration**: Saves configuration data on the built-in ROM for reliability across power cycles.
- **Encryption & Decryption**: Integrated library ensures secure communication.
- **Over-The-Air (OTA) Updates**: Take advantage of AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation to push new updates effortlessly.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aminm1364/SmartRelay.git
   
2. Install the required dependencies via ```Arduino IDE``` or ```PlatformIO``` on ```VSCode```.
3. Upload the firmware to your microcontroller.
4. Configure your WIFI network connection details, MQTT broker details, and the rest by running the code on an MCU (e.g. ESP8266) and data entry from its Serial port.
